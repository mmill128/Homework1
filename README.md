Program # 1

Name:Moriah Miller
Cosc 4730

Description: (how to run the program, phone/emulator screen size, android version ie 7.0)
  To run the program, you just have to type your name into the textbox and press the enter enter button (after closing the keyboard). The program will then welcome you! The tested screen size is 4.7, 768 x 1280, xhdpi (Nexus 4), Android version 4.1 (Jellybean).

Anything that doesn't work:
  Running the app with the phone powered off. HAHA. Just kidding. Please don't dock me points for that.
